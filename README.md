# Happy9AM Event Messenger
A Ruby on Rails application that automatically sends scheduled event messages to users at 9:00 AM in their local timezone. With reliable scheduling, missed message recovery, and user-friendly APIs, Happy9AM ensures that important events like birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries are never forgotten!

## Key Features
- **Timezone-Aware Scheduling**: Ensures messages are sent at the correct local time.
- **Message Recovery**: Recovers missed messages in case of service interruptions.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Supports multiple event types (e.g., birthdays, holidays, anniversaries) using the Strategy Pattern.
- **Scalable Processing**: Uses Sidekiq for efficient background job management.


## Why Use `message_log` Table?
- **Prevent Duplicates**: Ensures each user gets only one message per event per day.
- **Recover Missed Messages**: Identifies and resends missed messages due to system failures.
- **Track Status**: Logs message success or failure for debugging and auditing.

## Preventing Duplicate Jobs with EventJobLock
One of the most critical aspects of this system is ensuring that event messages are not enqueued multiple times for the same user within a single day. This is achieved using the `EventJobLock` service, which leverages Redis to control job execution.

### Why `EventJobLock`?
- **Ensures Idempotency**: Prevents redundant job enqueues by setting a Redis key as a lock.
- **Optimized Performance**: Reduces unnecessary Sidekiq job processing, improving system efficiency.
- **Centralized Management**: Provides a clean, maintainable way to control job execution across the application.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.4.2
- Rails 8.0.1
- PostgreSQL
   - Why? Its simplicity makes it ideal for development and testing, reducing setup time and overhead while still fulfilling the test requirements.
   - For production or larger-scale systems requiring high concurrency, complex queries, or robust data integrity, PostgreSQL would be a better choice.
- Redis (for Sidekiq)

### Installation

Cronjob setup
```yaml
:scheduler:
  :schedule:
    birthday_event_scheduler:
      every: '1h' #Run every 1 hour to balance efficiency and accuracy.
      class: ScheduledEventJob
      args:
        - 'birthday' # Event type (can be 'birthday', 'holiday', etc.)
        - 9 # Target hour for event execution in the user's local timezone.
```


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:lily-vu-goldenowl/Happy9AM.git && cd Happy9AM
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Database setup:
   ```bash
   rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
   ```

4. Environment configuration:
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file or set in your environment
   # cp sample.env .env
   HOOKBIN_URL=your_hookbin_endpoint_url
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
   ```

5. Start the services:
   ```bash
   # Start Rails server
   rails server

   # In a separate terminal, start Sidekiq
   bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml

   # If you want to check it right away, you can run the command:
   bundle exec rails runner "ScheduledEventJob.perform_async('birthday', 9)"
   ```
## Running Sidekiq Tasks Manually

If you need to trigger birthday message processing manually without waiting for the cron job, use the following Rake tasks.

### 1. Schedule Birthday Jobs
This command schedules birthday messages for users, ensuring they will be processed at 9 AM local time.

```sh
rake sidekiq:schedule_birthdays
```
**Sample Output:**
```log
2025-03-14T07:23:48.394Z pid=80273 tid=1qtd INFO: Sidekiq 7.3.9 connecting to Redis with options {size: 10, pool_name: "internal", url: "redis://localhost:6379/0"}
âœ… ScheduledEventJob enqueued for processing birthdays!
```

### 2. Send Birthday Messages Immediately
Use this command to send birthday messages to users who have a birthday today but haven't received a message yet.

```sh
rake sidekiq:send_event_messages
```

**Sample Output:**
```log
ðŸŽ‰ Sent birthday message to Johnny Price
ðŸŽ‰ Sent birthday message to Loyce Satterfield
```
